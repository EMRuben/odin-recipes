        and often various other ingredients</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            </ul>
        <p>For the topping:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>125 g <b>ball mozzarella</b>, sliced</li>
                <li>handful <b>grated or shaved parmesan</b> (or vegetarian alternative)</li>
                <li>handful of <b>cherry tomatoes</b>, halved</li>
            </ul>
        <p>To finish:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>handful of <b>basil leaves</b> (optional)</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, 
                then stir in the yeast and salt. Make a well, 
                pour in 200ml warm water and the olive 
                oil and bring together with a wooden spoon 
                until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. 
                Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead 
                for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel 
                and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise 
                if you like, but it's not essential for a thin crust.</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and 
                crushed garlic together, then season to taste. 
                Leave to stand at room temperature while you get 
                on with shaping the base.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, 
                give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. 
                On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large 
                rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. 
                The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise 
                in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured 
                baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. 
                Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray 
                in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases 
                with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese 
                and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. 
                Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, 
                on top of the preheated sheet or tray. 
                Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. 
                Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves 
                if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</li>
